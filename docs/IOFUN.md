IO FUN
------

Hola, what we are doing is following the pursuit of John Carmack's idea
of focus on doing a generalized infrastructure, a kind of meta or multiverse,
build around the internet, concurrency and asynchronous computation.

In the past we've found Constructivism as the design guide for human universal experiences.

For the future, we take Carl Hewitt's Actors theory as the universal proved model of computation.

We're making a set of tools based on common sense, analogies and simple abstractions.

We use the name of tropical fruits and animals for our products; demons, gods or beasts on our services.

Mango manage, measure and gives new meaning to ORGs data records, 
Organizations of restricted generality (ORGs) provide foundations 
for the development of scalable, robust, and private cloud-native 
applications.

Cas a central actor system for Python 3 and cebus the artificial intelligence 
entity that plays with every single daemon running on our tropical cloud forest.

Cebus is our first baby AI project in wich we mix the results of our research
with the combination of Python and Erlang on the same actor technology system.

Cebus is also the scientific name of the central american Capuchin monkey
and we don't lie when we say that we plan to feed ours with bananas and
starfruit's that talks with networks of asterisks on different places
all of that supervising our generalized open source infrastructure.

Lets have some fun together on this adventure.
