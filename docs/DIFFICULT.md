Why Programming is Difficult
----------------------------

Input -> (program) -> Output

Definition1: A program is something that transforms inputs to outputs,

A programmer is the person who writes the program, and programming is the act of writing this program.

Now let's add a few constraints the definition of program.

Definition 2: A program is something that transforms inputs to outputs, subject to the following constraints:

    The output of the program is beautiful.
    The input to the program is beautiful.
    The program is beautiful.
    The input to the program is well and correctly documented.
    The program itself is well and correctly documented.
    The program is well tested and proved correct.
    The problem being solved is well specified.
    The problem is well specified.

With these added constraints programming becomes extremely difficult.
