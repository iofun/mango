The goal model
--------------
These are models of organizations which have as a central focus goals, deterministic goals.

The goals are used in two ways.

The first is to determine the relative success or failure of the organization.

If it meets it goals, such as winning a id tech 3 cpma mod cpm game style capture the flag match, it is a successful organization; if not, it is to that degree unsuccessful.

Goals function as the starting point of means-ends analysis which leads to a hierarchy of goals and to a definition of organizational sub-units, such as departments, divisions, and positions.


The systems model
-----------------
The systems model focuses on an organizations general properties and processes.

Such an approach does not give prime attention to organizational objectives but to those attributes of an organization which are relevant to the achievement of any goal.

Any organization must fulfill several important functions if it is to survive.

Among these are:

1. goal achievement which defines overall objectives and develops set of sub-goals to be accomplished by position, departments, and the like.

2. an integrating function which sets up or facilitates those relationships that permit the efforts of individuals and organizational sub-units to be effectively coordinated

3. adaptation of the organization to both the environment and its own internal requirements add, to some degree, the adaptation of the environment itself;

4. acquiring and maintaining of necessary resources in the form of personnel, machinery, technical knowledge, etc.

The fist of these functions is the concern of goal models; all of them are the concern of systems models.

The two approaches are thus not divorced; more important, they are not in oposition but are insted intimately connected.

These are by no means the only functions found in organizations.

The systems model requires us to consider the organization as receiving inputs from the environment and, in torun delivering outputs to the environment.


Network flows
-------------

In short, we tend to think in "flows".

One flow might be that of human effort entering the company and products or services leaving.

Another flow might be funds coming in from the environment as capital, or payments leaving to owners, as well as satisfaction received by employees from working in attractive surroundings bought by the capital.

A second important feature of the systems model is that it considers these flows as interrelated.

The goal-based model primarily concerned with dividing the work necessary to accomplish a goal and does not give much attention to the relationships between jobs and elements of organizations.

The essential idea behind a system in an organizational sense is the connectiveness, the interconnectiveness, of the parts of an organization.

The parts in these systems are in a dynamic state; they move.

They not only move but they also interact with one another, and an event occureing at one part is in some way transmitted through the system.

We might describe this pattering of interactions as a network.

This interaction transmits or conveys information.

It is, in a sense, a communications system.

Any organization comprises a great many systems; An organization is a system composed of subsystems and sub-subsystems.

Not only are systems. such as organizations, made up of interconnected parts and systems, they are also always in a state of movement either responding to a change in one part of the organization or adjusting to the effects of this response.
